      <h1 className="saltLamps section-title">The Ancient Himalayan salt</h1> 
       <p>Pink Himalayan salt is a pink-colored salt extracted from the Khewra Salt Mine, which is located near the Himalayas in Pakistan.

       <br/><br/>
       The Khewra Salt Mine is one of the oldest and largest salt mines in the world.

       The pink Himalayan salt harvested from this mine is believed to have been formed millions of years ago from the evaporation of ancient bodies of water.  </p> 
       <br></br>

       <h1 className="saltLamps">A Salt Over 250 Million Years Old</h1>
       <p>It is the purest salt available on earth and is absolutely uncontaminated with any toxins or pollutants. It contains over 84 different trace minerals  </p>
       <br></br>

       <h1 className="saltLamps">The Purest Salt on Earth</h1>
       <p> Derived from natural deposits found in the Himalayan foothills and the Punjab region of Pakistan, Himalayan salt is naturally rich in iodine and known for their pure taste and infuse a rich flavour. It has been maturing for over 250 million years under the Himalayan foothills and extreme tectonic pressure. It is mined and then washed by hand and is natural and unprocessed which is why it is famously called the purest salt on earth. </p>
       <br></br>

       
        {/* <h1 className="saltLamps"> Containing all of the 84 elements found in your body, the benefits of natural Himalayan Crystal Salt include:</h1> */}

        <h1 className="saltLamps">Helps your body detoxify</h1>
        <p>Himalayan salt contains more than 80 minerals and elements, including potassium, iron and calcium. All of these minerals aid our body’s natural detoxification process and promote the removal of bacteria.</p>  
        <br></br> 

        <h1 className="saltLamps">lowers blood pressure</h1>
        <p>When you swap table salt for Himalayan salt, your body has an easier time processing it because it doesn’t require as much water to clear out the excess sodium as it would have if you had consumed table salt. Table salt is highly processed and contains fewer minerals and more sodium than Himalayan salt does. </p>   
        <br></br> 


        <h1 className="saltLamps">promotes healthy pH and digestion</h1>
        <p>Himalayan salt’s rich mineral content helps balance your body’s pH levels. When our pH levels are balanced, our bodies have better immunity, nourished brain cells and are better able to process and digest food. </p>   
        <br></br>

       <h1 className="saltLamps section-title"> The Himalayan salt lamp</h1> 
       <p>purify the air through an operation called hygroscopy, which attracts and absorbs contaminated water molecules from the immediate environment and locks them into the salt crystal. The process has the amazing ability to remove cigarette smoke, dust and other contaminants from the air. This benefit is particularly popular, as salty air acts as an overall health booster and can help clear the air passages.  </p> 
       <br></br>

       <h1 className="saltLamps">Boost Blood Flow</h1>
       <p> Negative ions emitted by Himalayan salt lamps can accelerate blood flow. This boost helps to improve several disorders of the vascular system and can prevent certain damage to the lungs.
       </p>
       <br></br>

        <h1 className="saltLamps"> Raise Energy Levels</h1>
        <p>The negative ions released from salt lamps counter the positive ones. Positive ions deplete the body of energy and are in forms of pollution, toxic chemicals, pet dander, pollen and mold
         <br></br><br></br>
         
        Negative ions released from salt lamps counter the positive ones by attracting them. By eliminating positive ions, Salt lamps yield a refreshing effect similar to the feeling of rejuvenation achieved from spending time in nature. 
       </p>
       <br></br>
       
        <h1 className="saltLamps"> Sharpen Concentration and Performance </h1>
        <p>Since himalayan salt lamps increase negative air ions, this reduces stress and enhances overall performance. Negative ions increase blood and oxygen supplies to the brain, making Himalayan salt lamps great at improving concentration. They also provide a boost of the neurotransmitter serotonin. The ambient light that they produce creates a pleasant working atmosphere. 
       </p>
       <br></br>

      
        <h1 className="saltLamps"> Improve Sleep</h1> 
        <p>Positive ions reduces the brain’s blood and oxygen supply, which can lead to irregular sleeping patterns. The negative ions from a Himalayan salt lamp are said to reverse this effect, making them a popular sleep aid. The soothing light can help people who suffer from insomnia.
